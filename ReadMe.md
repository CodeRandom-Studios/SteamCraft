# SteamCraft Mod for Minecraft Bedrock Edition

## Overview

SteamCraft is a steampunk-inspired mod for **Minecraft Bedrock Edition (1.21.82)**, developed by **CodeRandom Studios**. Built using the **Beta Scripting API v2** and **Custom Block Components v2**, SteamCraft seamlessly integrates with vanilla Minecraft, introducing a tech progression system that utilizes redstone, copper, water, and steam. Inspired by the Java Edition’s Create mod, SteamCraft focuses on intuitive automation through kinetic, steam, and electric power stages.

This mod adds new blocks, items, and mechanics for crafting machines, generating power, and automating processes, all while preserving Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic. Players progress through a tech tree, starting with simple kinetic machines and advancing to complex electric systems, requiring resources from the Overworld, Nether, and End.

## Features

- **Kinetic Stage**: Early-game automation with Wind Turbines, Water Wheels, Crushers, Smelters, and Kinetic Water Pumps, powered by mechanical energy.
- **Steam Stage**: Mid-game systems using Coal Boilers, Steam Crushers, Steam Smelters, and Steam Water Pumps, fueled by steam from water and solid fuels.
- **Electric Stage**: Late-game industrial machines like Coal Generators, Steam Turbines, Electric Crushers, Smelters, and Water Pumps, powered by electricity.
- **Piping and Transmission**: Fluid Pipes, Pressure Pipes, Copper Wires, and Kinetic Shafts for transporting water, steam, energy, and kinetic power.
- **Redstone Integration**: Machines interact with redstone signals for toggling, modulation, and automation.
- **Progression**: A tech tree that aligns with vanilla Minecraft, requiring Overworld, Nether, and End resources for advancement.
- **Immersive Design**: Rustic visuals, dynamic particles (smoke, steam, sparks), and sounds (clanks, hisses, hums) enhance the steampunk aesthetic.

## Installation

1. **Download**: Obtain the `SteamCraft.mcaddon` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/coderandom-studios/SteamCraft/releases) page.
2. **Install**: Double-click the `.mcaddon` file or import it into Minecraft Bedrock Edition. The mod will automatically install as a behavior pack.
3. **Activate**: In your world settings, enable the mod under "Behavior Packs" and ensure Experimental Features (Beta APIs) are turned on.
4. **Requirements**: Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.21.82 or later with Experimental Features enabled.

## Usage

- **Getting Started**: Craft a Wind Turbine or Water Wheel to generate kinetic energy. Use a Kinetic Shaft to power a Crusher or Smelter.
- **Progression**: Unlock the Steam Stage by crafting a Coal Boiler with Nether resources, then advance to the Electric Stage with Coal Generators and Steam Turbines.
- **Automation**: Use hoppers, pipes, and redstone to create automated setups for crushing, smelting, and fluid transport.
- **Tools**: Craft a Wrench to configure block directions and pipe connections.

## Development Status

This is the initial commit, with the mod in early development. Current focus:

- Implementing Kinetic Stage blocks (Crusher, Smelter, Kinetic Water Pump, Wind Turbine, Water Wheel).
- Setting up basic kinetic energy and item transport mechanics.
- Planning Steam and Electric Stage systems.

See the [Development Plan](docs/development_plan.md) for a detailed roadmap.
